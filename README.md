# Full Stack Social Media App

This project is a full stack application utilizing the MERN stack and is a mock replica of the X (Twitter) platform.

The client side is built using React compenents and pages and routing is handled through React Router. Also the styling for this application was done using TailwindCSS and DaisyUI themes to accomplish the black and white theme that X iconically uses.

The database is built using MongoDB and server side routing and APIs are built using Node.js and Express.js.

In it's current state, the application allows users to sign up/login, create posts, follow/unfollow other useres, like posts, and edit their personal information.

Future updates to this application will include a functional reshare button, a unique theme and styling, and a search feature so users can find other users by name or email.
